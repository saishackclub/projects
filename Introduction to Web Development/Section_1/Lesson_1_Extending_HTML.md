# Extending our HTML capabilities

Now that we know a little bit about HTML, let's look at a couple of (optional) ways to add some extra functionality to our website. We'll be using a couple of new tags, so let's take a look at them.

## Adding a table: `<table>` and `<tr>`

The `<table>` tag is used to create a table. The `<tr>` tag is used to create a table row. Let's take a look at an example:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>First Name</td>
    <td>Last Name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

This will create a table that looks like this:

| First Name | Last Name |
| ---------- | --------- |
| John       | Doe       |

## Adding a list: `<ul>`/`<ol>` and `<li>`

The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list. The `<li>` tag is used to create a list item. Let's take a look at an example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

This will create a list that looks like this:

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

On the other hand, the `<ol>` tag is used to create an ordered list. Let's take a look at an example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

This will create another list that looks like this:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Adding a video: `<video>`

The `<video>` tag is used to embed a video. Let's take a look at an example:

```html
<video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" controls></video>
```

This will embed a video that looks like this:

[![Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Video)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Adding an audio file: `<audio>`

Similarly, the `<audio>` tag is used to embed an audio file. Let's take a look at an example:

```html
<audio src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" controls></audio>
```

## A little task for you
