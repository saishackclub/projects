# Experimenting with React

React is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to build websites that are fast, interactive, and responsive. You'll learn how to use React to make your website look and work the way you want it to. It's originally developed by Facebook, and is now maintained by a community of developers. It's used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix.

## Why use React?

One of the biggest advantages of using React is that it makes building websites completely modular. You can build different parts of your website as separate components, and then combine them together to make your website. This makes it easy to reuse code, and to make changes to your website without having to change the entire website.

Additionally, React is fast. It uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes to your website, and only updates the parts of your website that have changed. This makes your website faster, and makes it easier to debug your website.

## What will we be building?

We're going to be re-creating your website using React. We'll be using similar HTML and CSS that you used in the previous sections, but we'll be using React to make your website more powerful. We'll also be adding a project gallery to your website, so that you can show off your other projects on GitHub.
