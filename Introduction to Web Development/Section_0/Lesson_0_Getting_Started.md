# Getting Started

## Why should I learn web development?

**tl; dr: Websites are everywhere, and knowing how to make one is a really useful (and fun!) skill to have.**

You can use it to make websites for yourself, for your friends, for your school, or for your business. You can also use it to make websites for other people, and get paid for it.

## So, what will I learn?

This project will teach you the basics of web development, and how to make your own website. You'll learn how to use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to make your website look and work the way you want it to. You'll also learn how to use **Git and GitHub** to collaborate with other people on your website.

Then, we are going to take it a step further and learn how to use **React** to make your website even more powerful. React is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to build websites that are fast, interactive, and responsive. You'll learn how to use React to make your website look and work the way you want it to.

## What do I need to get started?

- A computer with an internet connection
- A text editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A command line interface (just use the one that comes with your computer)
